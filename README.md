# Beeniez, a language targeting NQP.
### Beeniez is also known as Beenz and Weenies.

### This language is ***NOT*** made to be fast. Its made to be ***FUN***. See FUN.txt for more info.

#### Beeniez was a language created by developer Adam Stanley, I (fsh) am the new maintainer. I have decided to publish this language to the public.

#### Beeniez is just a language standard. If a language can pass all tests in [test.raku](./test.raku) it is Beeniez.
